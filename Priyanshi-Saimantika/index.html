                    <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the world.
                        As of April 11, 2020, approximately 1,741,621 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in over 210 countries and territories resulting in around 106,670 deaths. Clearly, the corona virus outbreak situation cannot be taken lightly. Global pandemic of COVID 19, its ophthalmic implications, and precautions are nicely summarized in recently published editorial.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Who are Corona Warriors?</h2>
                    <p>
                        While on one hand people across India and around the globe are largely confined to their homes with businesses and educational institutions all shut down in an attempt to contain the virus, and on the other hand doctors, health-care workers, and medical staff members are leading the battle against COVID-19 from the front. Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs. 
        <br>Front line warriors are not only facing a daunting task of handling and treating patients, but are also struggling to keep their own worries and emotional stress at bay. To add an insult to their mental health is the stigma that they have to face from the society. Some landlords have asked them to vacate their homes due to the irrational fear of getting infected. In the hospital too, anaesthesiologists are not immune to the wrath of the public. These warriors are outcaste by the society members and neighbours.
